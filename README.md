# Straighten Short Curves
Glyphs.app plug-in for straightening curve segments shorter than a certain threshold length. The handles are deleted and the curve segment is turned into a line segment. Useful for cleaning up a vectorized scan or avoiding *Remove Overlap* errors at export.

### Installation

1. One-click install *Straighten Short Curves* from *Window > Plugin Manager > Plugins*
2. Restart Glyphs.

### System Requirements

The plug-in requires Glyphs&nbsp;3.1 or later, and probably macOS&nbsp;10.15 or later. YMMV.
